# DSA Solver Agent

This project implements a DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Solver Agent that can automatically solve coding problems, explain solutions, and assist with algorithmic learning. The agent is designed for students, educators, and professionals preparing for technical interviews or improving their problem-solving skills.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: To provide an AI-powered assistant for solving, explaining, and teaching DSA problems.
- **Features**:
  - Accepts coding problems in various formats (text, files, user input).
  - Selects appropriate algorithms and data structures to solve problems.
  - Generates step-by-step solutions and code implementations.
  - Explains the reasoning and complexity behind each solution.
  - Can be extended to support custom problem sets or competitive programming.
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - A student wants to practice binary search or dynamic programming problems.
  - An educator needs automated explanations for classroom exercises.
  - A job seeker wants to simulate technical interview questions and get instant feedback.

## System Architecture and Workflow

1. **User submits a DSA problem or task.**
2. **`agent_backend.py`, `app.py`, `main.py`**: Handle input, orchestrate agent logic, and manage the solution process.
3. **Agents**: Defined in the `agents/` folder, each agent specializes in a type of DSA problem or solution strategy.
4. **Configuration**: The `config/` folder contains files for setting up agent parameters and environment variables.
5. **Team Management**: The `teams/` folder manages collaborative workflows among multiple agents.
6. **Temporary Data**: The `temp/` folder stores intermediate data, results, or user submissions.
7. **Utilities**: The `utils/` folder provides helper functions for common tasks.

## What You Will Learn
- How to build and organize an agent system for algorithmic problem solving.
- How to manage agent teams, configuration, and workflow.
- How to extend the system for new types of DSA problems.

By reading this README and exploring the files, you will gain a clear understanding of how to design, deploy, and extend a DSA Solver Agent using AutoGen.
