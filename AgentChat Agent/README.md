# AgentChat Agent

This folder is a comprehensive guide to building chat-based agent systems in AutoGen. It covers the creation, communication, monitoring, and enhancement of conversational agents.

## Key Concepts and Notebooks

- **Creating and Managing Chat Agents**
  - `agent.ipynb`:
    - Introduces the basics of defining and launching chat agents.
    - Explains agent roles, message handling, and lifecycle management.

- **Message Formats and Communication**
  - `messages.ipynb`:
    - Details the structure of messages exchanged between agents.
    - Explains protocols for agent-to-agent and agent-to-user communication.
    - Shows how to interpret and route messages in multi-agent settings.

- **Running and Observing Conversations**
  - `running_&_observing.ipynb`:
    - Demonstrates how to execute agent conversations and monitor their progress.
    - Explains logging, debugging, and visualization of chat flows.

- **Structured Output**
  - `structured_output.ipynb`:
    - Explains how agents can produce structured outputs (e.g., JSON, tables) for downstream processing.
    - Shows how to parse and use structured data from agent responses.

- **Tool Integration**
  - `tools.ipynb`:
    - Shows how to equip agents with external tools for enhanced capabilities.
    - Explains dynamic tool selection and usage during conversations.

## Why Use These Resources?
- To build robust conversational agents for chatbots, assistants, or collaborative AI systems.
- To understand message handling, structured output, and tool integration in agent workflows.

By reading this README and exploring the notebooks, you will gain a practical understanding of designing, running, and extending chat-based agents in AutoGen.
