# Autogen Projects

This folder contains a collection of project-level scripts and experimental applications built with AutoGen. Each project demonstrates a specific use case, serving as a template or inspiration for building new agent-based solutions.

## Example Project: AI-Interviewer.py

- **Purpose**: Implements an AI-driven interviewer agent that can conduct mock interviews, ask questions, evaluate answers, and provide feedback.
- **Features**:
  - Simulates real interview scenarios for technical, behavioral, or custom topics.
  - Adapts questions based on user responses.
  - Provides instant feedback and scoring.
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - A job seeker practices for interviews with realistic AI-driven questions.
  - An educator creates automated interview simulations for students.
  - A recruiter screens candidates with consistent, unbiased questioning.
