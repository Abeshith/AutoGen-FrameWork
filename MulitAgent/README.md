# MulitAgent

This folder is a comprehensive guide to building and managing multi-agent systems in AutoGen. The notebooks and files here demonstrate how to coordinate, monitor, and control teams of agents for complex tasks.

## Key Concepts and Notebooks

- **Team State Management**
  - `load_teamstate.ipynb`, `managing_multiAgent_state.ipynb`, `team_state.json`:
    - Show how to load, save, and manage the state of multiple agents and teams.
    - Explain strategies for synchronizing agent state and ensuring consistency.

- **Multi-Agent Workflows**
  - `multiagent.ipynb`, `singleagent_team.ipynb`:
    - Introduce the basics of multi-agent and single-agent team workflows.
    - Demonstrate how to assign roles, distribute tasks, and coordinate actions.

- **Team Operations and Monitoring**
  - `observing_teams.ipynb`, `team_operations.ipynb`:
    - Show how to observe, monitor, and perform operations on agent teams.
    - Explain techniques for tracking progress, debugging, and optimizing team performance.

- **Termination Handling**
  - `termination.ipynb`:
    - Explains how to handle agent and team termination gracefully.
    - Discusses strategies for cleanup, state saving, and recovery.

## Why Use These Concepts?
- To build scalable, robust, and flexible multi-agent systems.
- To manage complex workflows that require collaboration among multiple agents.

By reading this README and exploring the notebooks, you will gain a practical understanding of multi-agent state management, team operations, and advanced coordination in AutoGen.
