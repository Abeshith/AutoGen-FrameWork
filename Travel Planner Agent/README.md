# Travel Planner Agent

This project implements an intelligent Travel Planner Agent that helps users plan trips, generate itineraries, and manage travel logistics. The agent leverages AI to automate the process of finding flights, booking hotels, suggesting activities, and optimizing travel schedules based on user preferences.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: To provide an automated assistant that can handle all aspects of travel planning, from initial research to final itinerary generation.
- **Features**:
  - Accepts user preferences (destinations, dates, budget, interests).
  - Searches for flights, hotels, and activities using integrated agents.
  - Generates optimized, day-by-day itineraries.
  - Adapts plans based on user feedback or changes.
  - Can be extended to include weather checks, visa requirements, and more.
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - A user wants a week-long trip to Japan with a focus on culture and food.
  - A business traveler needs a multi-city itinerary with minimal layovers.
  - A family wants suggestions for kid-friendly activities in Paris.

## System Architecture and Workflow

1. **User submits travel preferences or requirements.**
2. **`main.py`**: Handles input, orchestrates agent logic, and manages the planning process.
3. **Agents**: Defined in the `agents/` folder, each agent specializes in a travel planning task (e.g., finding flights, booking hotels, creating itineraries).
4. **Configuration**: The `config/` folder contains files for setting up agent parameters and environment variables.
5. **Models**: The `models/` folder implements model clients for interacting with language models or APIs.
6. **Team Management**: The `teams/` folder manages collaborative workflows among multiple agents.
7. **Testing**: The `tests/` folder contains test cases for validating agent functionality and reliability.
8. **Utilities**: The `utils/` folder provides helper functions for common tasks.

## What You Will Learn
- How to build and organize an agent system for travel planning.
- How to manage agent teams, configuration, and workflow.
- How to extend the system for new travel-related tasks or integrations.
