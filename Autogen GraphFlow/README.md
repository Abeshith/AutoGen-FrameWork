# Autogen GraphFlow

This folder explores advanced agent workflow orchestration and memory management using graph-based approaches in AutoGen. The notebooks here are designed to help you understand how agents can manage complex dependencies and retain context across tasks.

## Key Concepts and Notebooks

- **Graph-Based Workflows**
  - `graphflow.ipynb`:
    - Demonstrates how to represent agent tasks and dependencies as a graph.
    - Explains how agents can traverse, schedule, and execute tasks based on graph structure.
    - Useful for scenarios where tasks are interdependent or require dynamic ordering.

- **Memory Management**
  - `Memory.ipynb`:
    - Explains strategies for storing, retrieving, and updating agent memory.
    - Shows how agents can persist context, recall past actions, and use memory to inform future decisions.
    - Useful for building agents that need long-term context or stateful behavior.

## Why Use These Concepts?
- To orchestrate complex agent workflows with dependencies.
- To enable agents to remember and leverage past experiences.

By reading this README and exploring the notebooks, you will gain a practical understanding of graph-based workflow design and memory management in agent systems.
