# Advanced Integrations

This folder explores advanced ways to extend and control agent behavior in AutoGen, focusing on real-time feedback, interaction limits, and tool integration. The notebooks here are designed to help you understand and implement these concepts in your own agent systems.

## Concepts and Notebooks

- **Feedback During Runs (`feedback_during_runs.ipynb`)**:
  - Explains how agents can receive and act on feedback while a task is still running.
  - Shows how to design feedback loops, allowing users or other agents to guide the agent's actions in real time.
  - Discusses practical scenarios, such as correcting an agent's approach or providing hints during problem solving.

- **Feedback Max Turns (`feedback_max_turns.ipynb`)**:
  - Demonstrates how to set a maximum number of interaction turns between agents and users.
  - Useful for controlling resource usage, preventing infinite loops, and ensuring timely task completion.
  - Includes strategies for gracefully handling turn limits and summarizing results when the limit is reached.

- **Tools in AutoGen (`tools_in_autogen.ipynb`)**:
  - Introduces the concept of equipping agents with external tools (e.g., calculators, web search, file access).
  - Explains how agents can select and use tools dynamically during a task.
  - Provides examples of tool integration, such as fetching data, running code, or accessing APIs.

## Why Use These Integrations?
- To make agents more interactive and adaptable to user needs.
- To enforce boundaries and ensure predictable agent behavior.
- To empower agents with capabilities beyond their built-in knowledge.

## Practical Applications
- Interactive tutoring systems that adapt to student feedback.
- Automated assistants that can use external resources to solve complex tasks.
- Systems that require strict control over agent-user interaction cycles.

By reading this README and exploring the notebooks, you will gain a clear understanding of how to:
- Implement feedback mechanisms for live agent guidance.
- Set and manage interaction limits for agents.
- Integrate and manage tools to extend agent functionality.
